# Truck and Trail Database
In addition to the main objective of creating a user-friendly, scalable, and reliable database system, I also developed the logic model and conceptual model, which were instrumental in designing the relational model for the Truck Trail Database. Through careful analysis of the requirements, I established a robust and efficient structure for the database, enabling optimal information retrieval and management related to truck trails. The logic model and conceptual model played a crucial role in guiding the database development process, resulting in a well-structured and comprehensive system for storing, managing, and analyzing truck trail data.
